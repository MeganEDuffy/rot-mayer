#### Abstract

Proteins make up over half of phytoplankton biomass, thus the ability to trace their fate from the surface to the deep ocean is critical to understanding marine carbon and nitrogen cycling. In a simulated bloom of the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and subsequent degradation in natural seawater, we tracked the evolution of algal protein through high-resolution mass spectrometry peptidomics and its availability via enzymatically hydrolyzable amino acid analysis. We find that as the enzymatic availability of diatom proteins decreased over the 12-day degradation, peptides became enriched in glycine and aliphatic residues and depleted of aromatic amino acids (???? MAYBE!). Peptides increasingly had modifications such as deamidation and XXXX. Functional analysis of the peptide sequences show that certain motifs (XXXX) are preferentially degraded while (XXX) are preserved.
